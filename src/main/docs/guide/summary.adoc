Of course this project has been a bit unusual in that we were taking an
app designed with one technology stack and reimplementing in another.
However, hopefully this exercise has shown you the capabilities and
flexibility of the Grails framework, particularly with the minimal
amount of changes needed to use the same React app against the new
Grails backend. Grails offers a slew of powerful web development
features that we havenâ€™t had occasion or time to demonstrate in this app
- including JSON views, HAL+JSON support, custom data validation and
constraints, NoSQL support, multi-tenancy, and much more. Please check
out the http://guides.grails.org[Grails Guides website] for more
tutorials on building fun and powerful apps with Grails (including
several Guides featuring React).
